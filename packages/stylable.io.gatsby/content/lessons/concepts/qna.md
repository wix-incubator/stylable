Q: How much documentation is enough? 

To warm your hands, a ball of yarn and a pair of knitting needles need much more
documentation than a pair of gloves made from the same yarn. (с) Bob Watson http://docsbydesign.com/2017/09/20/a-brief-history-of-api-docs/

Q: What information is to be included?

1. Think of your audience and the product lifecycle and all the use and maintenance scenarios. Bare them in mind when you planning the doc outline. Typical roles: administrator (per domain: network, system, security, operations, sys config), user (per domain: e.g. ba, qa, pm, sales, marketing, support), developer (per domain) Other factors to consider: hobbyists/profs, newbies/experienced, tools that will be used for integration/access, etc.
2. Depending on the type of the software you are delivering, the information structure will change. Consider these types of the deliverables and think of the info you'd like to cover:
